    "### Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "1. The program starts by importing the necessary libraries: `requests` for making HTTP requests, and `json` for working with JSON data.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. The `download_data` function is defined. It takes a URL as input and uses the `requests.get()` method to make a GET request to that URL. If the response status code is 200 (indicating a successful request), the JSON response is returned using the `.json()` method of the response object. Otherwise, it returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. The `extract_data` function is defined. It takes the downloaded JSON data as input. The function first assigns the entire JSON data to the `show_data` variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Next, the function extracts the show details from the `show_data` dictionary. The desired attributes like show ID, URL, name, type, summary, and image links (medium and original) are accessed using the corresponding keys in the `show_data` dictionary.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. The function then extracts the episode details from the `_embedded` key within the `show_data` dictionary. It iterates over each episode in the `episode_data` list and extracts attributes like episode ID, URL, season number, episode number, airdate, airtime, runtime, and rating. These attributes are stored in a list of dictionaries called `episodes`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. After extracting the show and episode details, the function returns a dictionary containing all the extracted information in the desired format.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. The `remove_html_tags` function is defined. It takes a text string as input and uses a regular expression (`re`) to remove any HTML tags from the text. The function replaces any text between `<` and `>` symbols with an empty string.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. In the main part of the program, the URL for the API request is provided. The `download_data` function is called to download the JSON data from the API.\n",
    "\n",
    "9. If the data is successfully downloaded (i.e., not `None`), the `extract_data` function is called to extract the desired information from the JSON data.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. The extracted data is then printed using the `json.dumps()` function with the `indent` parameter set to 4, which formats the output in a more readable manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "11. If the data fails to download (i.e., `None`), an error message is printed.\n",
    "\n",
    "the code fetches data from the provided API link, extracts the relevant show and episode information from the JSON response, and presents it in a structured and formatted manner."
